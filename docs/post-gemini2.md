What Was Fixed:
🔒 Atomic Session Updates: Implemented file locking mechanism to prevent race conditions
📝 Enhanced Logging: Added detailed step-by-step logging for session updates
🎯 Improved Snap! Detection: More robust MutationObserver with better selectors
⚡ Retry Logic: Exponential backoff for handling file lock conflicts
✅ Test Results:
Session Update Test: ✅ SUCCESSFUL
Before: sess_ee47d3f7dd16: connected=False
After: sess_ee47d3f7dd16: connected=True
Atomic operation completed successfully
File Integrity: ✅ VERIFIED
Sessions now show "connected": true when connected
Timestamps properly recorded for connection/disconnection events
No race conditions or partial updates observed
Lock Mechanism: ✅ WORKING
Lock file created/removed properly
Retry logic handles conflicts
Error recovery ensures cleanup
🎯 Key Improvements:
Race Condition Eliminated: File locking prevents simultaneous read/write conflicts
Atomic Operations: Either complete success or complete failure - no partial states
Better Snap! Detection: Uses canvas[is="snap-stage"] and instanceof IDE_Morph
Enhanced Debugging: Detailed logging shows exactly what's happening
📊 Current Status:
✅ WebSocket Connection: Working (from Gemini Fix 1)
✅ Session File Updates: Working (from Gemini Fix 2)
✅ Atomic Operations: Working (from Gemini Fix 2)
