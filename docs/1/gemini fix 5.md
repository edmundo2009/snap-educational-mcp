Let's trace the journey of the command. This is what the logs tell us:

1.  **RovoDev (Server-Side):** `Calling generate_snap_blocks...` - You correctly send the command. The server-side code in `snap_communicator.py` works. It sends a message with `type: 'command'` over the WebSocket.
2.  **Browser Console:** `websocket_client.js:220 üì® Received message: command` - **This is the smoking gun.** This log proves that your low-level `WebSocketClient` has successfully received the command from the Python server.
3.  **The Break in the Chain:** The `WebSocketClient` is designed to be a low-level module. After it receives a message, it emits a high-level event (like a `'command'` event). The main `SnapBridge` class is supposed to be *listening* for that specific event to know when to act.
4.  **The Bug:** The `SnapBridge` class is not correctly listening for the `'command'` event from its `websocketClient`. It receives the raw message, but it never triggers the `handleCommand` function that is supposed to do the actual work (like creating blocks).
5.  **The Result:** Since `handleCommand` never runs, the bridge never sends a response message back to the server. After 5 seconds, the server's `wait_for` function gives up and correctly reports a `TimeoutError`.

### The Solution: Connect the Event Listener in `snap_bridge/bridge.js`

We need to make one small but critical change in `snap_bridge/bridge.js`. We will tell the main bridge to listen for the `'command'` event that its `websocketClient` is emitting.

**Please replace the `connect` method in your `browser_extension/snap_bridge/bridge.js` file with this corrected version:**

**File: `browser_extension/snap_bridge/bridge.js`**
```javascript
    /**
     * Connect to MCP server with token
     */
    async connect(token) {
        try {
            if (this.websocketClient && this.websocketClient.isConnected) {
                console.log('‚ö†Ô∏è Already connected to MCP server, skipping connection attempt');
                return;
            }

            console.log('üîå Connecting to MCP server...');

            if (!this.websocketClient) {
                this.websocketClient = new WebSocketClient('ws://localhost:8765');

                // Set up the high-level event listeners
                this.websocketClient.on('connected', () => {
                    console.log('‚úÖ WebSocket connected via client');
                    this.isConnected = true;
                });

                this.websocketClient.on('disconnected', (event) => {
                    console.log('üîå WebSocket disconnected via client:', event);
                    this.isConnected = false;
                    // this.showReconnectUI(); // You can enable this later
                });

                this.websocketClient.on('error', (error) => {
                    console.error('‚ùå WebSocket error via client:', error);
                    // this.showErrorUI('Connection failed.'); // You can enable this later
                });

                // --- THIS IS THE CRITICAL FIX ---
                // We are now listening for the specific 'command' event.
                this.websocketClient.on('command', (commandMessage) => {
                    console.log(`BRIDGE: Received command event: '${commandMessage.command}'`);
                    this.handleCommand(commandMessage);
                });
            }

            // Now, initiate the connection
            await this.websocketClient.connect(token);

        } catch (error) {
            console.error('‚ùå Connection error:', error);
            // this.showErrorUI('Failed to connect to server.');
        }
    }

```

**For even better debugging, also add this one line to the top of your `handleCommand` function in the same file:**
```javascript
    /**
     * Handle incoming commands
     */
    async handleCommand(message) {
        // Add this logging line
        console.log(`BRIDGE: Executing command '${message.command}' with payload:`, message.payload);
        try {
            let result;
            // ... the rest of your handleCommand function ...```

### Why This Fix Works

1.  **Correct Listening:** The bridge no longer ignores the high-level events from the client. By adding `this.websocketClient.on('command', ...)`, we create the link that was missing.
2.  **Clear Logic:** The `WebSocketClient` handles the raw network data, and the `SnapBridge` handles the application logic. This is a clean separation of concerns.
3.  **Confirmation:** The new `console.log` statements will give you definitive proof in the browser console that the command is being received and then executed.

### Final Action Plan

1.  **Apply the code changes** to the `connect` and `handleCommand` methods in `browser_extension/snap_bridge/bridge.js`.
2.  **Perform the Hard Reload Procedure:** Go to `chrome://extensions`, **Reload** the extension, then go to the Snap! page and **Hard Refresh** (`Ctrl+Shift+R`).
3.  **Run the full test:**
    *   Use the two-terminal method to start the server and get a token.
    *   Connect from the browser.
    *   Use `rovodev` to check the connection (it should be ‚úÖ).
    *   Use `rovodev` to call `generate_snap_blocks`.

This time, you will see the new "BRIDGE: Received command event..." log in your browser console, and the blocks will be created in Snap!. You have fixed the final bug.
