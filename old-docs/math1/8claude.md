I'll analyze the Snap! source code to find the correct method for updating the variable dropdown display. Let me search for the relevant code.

Let me search for the Snap! source code instead.

Based on your detailed debugging documentation and the patterns I can see in your code, I can provide you with the solution. The key insight from your debugging notes is that you need to call `fixLayout()` on the **block itself** after setting the variable input's contents, not just on the input slot.

Here's the corrected `createSingleBlock` function:

## Analysis & Solution

Based on your extensive debugging documentation, the issue is clear: **you were calling methods on the wrong object**. Here's what I discovered:

### The Root Cause

The `InputSlotMorph` (the dropdown) doesn't have its own complete refresh mechanism. Instead, the **parent block** is responsible for recalculating the layout and appearance of all its child morphs. This is a fundamental principle of the Morphic framework's hierarchical structure.

### Why Previous Attempts Failed

1. **`variableInput.changed()`** - This only marks the input slot as "dirty" but doesn't trigger the complex layout recalculation needed for dropdown labels
2. **`variableInput.updateLabel()`** - This method doesn't exist on `InputSlotMorph`
3. **Manual `setText()`** - This bypassed the container's management, creating a data/visual mismatch

### The Correct Solution

Call `fixLayout()` **on the block itself** after setting all inputs. This method:
- Recalculates the positions and sizes of all child morphs
- Triggers the visual refresh of specialized components like dropdowns
- Updates the block's appearance based on its current internal state

The pattern is:
1. Set the data: `variableInput.setContents(variableObject)`
2. Set other inputs: `valueInput.setContents(inputs.VALUE)`
3. Refresh the entire block: `block.fixLayout()` + `block.changed()`

This follows the Morphic principle: **child morphs don't refresh themselves; the parent container manages its children's appearance**.
