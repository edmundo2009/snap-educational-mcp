Excellent, the new logs provide the critical clue. Let's break down what's happening and how to fix it.

### Analysis of the New Situation

1.  **The Good News:** The command queuing system is working perfectly. The log lines `BRIDGE: Received command 'create_blocks'. Ready state: false` and `queuing command until Snap! is ready.` show that the bridge is correctly deferring execution.

2.  **The Core Problem:** The readiness check is **never passing**. The log is filled with `⏳ Snap! not fully ready, checking again in 200ms...` until it finally hits the timeout: `❌ Timed out waiting for Snap! to become fully ready.`

3.  **The Contradiction:** The `robodev` backend reports `'snap_ready': True`, while the frontend extension reports it's not ready. This points to a fundamental disagreement on what "ready" means. The backend *thinks* it can send commands, but the frontend client knows the IDE isn't in a state to receive them. The command timeout (`Command create_blocks timed out`) is a direct symptom of this: the server sends the command, waits for a response that never comes (because the command is queued and never executed), and then gives up.

4.  **The Cause:** The issue lies within the conditions of the `isReady()` method in `snap_api_wrapper.js`. One or more of the properties being checked (`ide.stage`, `ide.sprites.asArray`, `ide.globalVariables`, or `ide.currentSprite`) are not available within the 45-second timeout window. The most likely culprits are `ide.currentSprite` which might not be set until a user interacts with the stage, or `ide.sprites.asArray` which might be a method on a prototype that isn't immediately available.

### The Solution: A More Lenient and Realistic Readiness Check

The `isReady()` check is currently too strict for the initial, pre-interaction state of the Snap! IDE. We need to adjust it to verify the essential components for block creation without depending on state that might appear later.

The most important things we need are the IDE object itself, the stage where sprites live, and the ability to access the sprite collection.

#### Step 1: Refine the `isReady()` Method

Let's create a more reliable readiness check that focuses on the core objects required for manipulation.

**File:** `browser_extension/snap_bridge/snap_api_wrapper.js`

```javascript
// REPLACE the current isReady() method with this more robust version.
isReady() {
    try {
        const ide = this.getIDE();

        // 1. We must have an IDE object.
        if (!ide) return false;

        // 2. The IDE must have a stage. This is where sprites and scripts live.
        if (!ide.stage) return false;

        // 3. The IDE must have its sprites collection initialized.
        //    We check for 'sprites' itself and a function that proves it's a Snap! list.
        if (!ide.sprites || typeof ide.sprites.asArray !== 'function') {
            return false;
        }
        
        // 4. Critically, we need to be able to find the main "Sprite".
        //    If we can detect the default sprite, we are ready to create blocks for it.
        const defaultSprite = ide.sprites.asArray().find(s => s.name === 'Sprite');
        if (!defaultSprite) {
             // This can happen briefly during initialization, so we log it for debugging.
             console.log("isReady Check: IDE and sprites are present, but default 'Sprite' not yet found.");
             return false;
        }

        // If all checks pass, we are truly ready.
        return true;

    } catch (e) {
        // If any property access fails, we are definitely not ready.
        console.warn('isReady check threw an error:', e.message);
        return false;
    }
}
```

#### Step 2: (Optional but Recommended) Add More Debugging to the Polling Loop

To get better insight if the problem persists, let's improve the logging in the `pollForSnapReadiness` function.

**File:** `browser_extension/snap_bridge/bridge.js`

```javascript
// Modify the pollForSnapReadiness method
pollForSnapReadiness() {
    let lastLogTime = 0;
    const readinessInterval = setInterval(() => {
        if (this.apiWrapper.isReady()) {
            clearInterval(readinessInterval);
            console.log('✅✅ Snap! IDE is fully loaded and ready for commands.');
            this.isSnapFullyReady = true;
            this.processCommandQueue();
        } else {
            // Log this message only once every 5 seconds to avoid spamming the console
            const now = Date.now();
            if (now - lastLogTime > 5000) {
                console.log('⏳ Snap! not fully ready, continuing to check...');
                lastLogTime = now;
            }
        }
    }, 200);

    setTimeout(() => {
        if (!this.isSnapFullyReady) {
            clearInterval(readinessInterval);
            console.error('❌ Timed out waiting for Snap! to become fully ready. The readiness check in snap_api_wrapper.js is likely failing.');
            // When we time out, reject any pending commands to notify the server.
            while (this.commandQueue.length > 0) {
                const command = this.commandQueue.shift();
                this.sendResponse(command.message_id, 'error', {
                    code: 'SNAP_NOT_READY',
                    message: 'Client-side timeout: The Snap! IDE did not become ready in time.'
                });
            }
        }
    }, 45000); 
}
```

### Why This New Approach Will Work

1.  **Focus on Essentials:** The new `isReady()` check verifies the existence of the `IDE`, `stage`, and the `sprites` collection. These are the absolute prerequisites for creating or manipulating blocks.
2.  **Avoids Volatile State:** It no longer checks for `ide.currentSprite`. This property is unreliable on initial load and often isn't set until the user clicks on a sprite. The `createBlocks` function is responsible for selecting the correct sprite by name anyway.
3.  **Verifies Collection Initialization:** By checking for `ide.sprites.asArray` and then actively trying to find the default "Sprite", we confirm that the internal data structures of Snap! are not just present, but populated and ready for use.
4.  **Improved Timeout Logic:** By sending an error response back to the server on timeout, the backend will no longer hang and report a generic "command timed out." It will receive a clear, actionable error: `SNAP_NOT_READY`.

After applying these changes, the polling should successfully complete, `isSnapFullyReady` will become `true`, the queued commands will be processed, and your blocks will be created as intended.
