This is fantastic! The logs show we are in the final stage of debugging. The connection is stable, the IDE is found, and commands are being received *while the IDE is ready*. This is a huge success.

The new error, `TypeError: ide.sprites.detect is not a function`, is a very specific and easily solvable problem related to the Snap! API itself.

### Root Cause Analysis

1.  **The Error:** The JavaScript engine is telling us that the object `ide.sprites` does not have a function (a method) called `detect`.
2.  **The Object:** `ide.sprites` is a special collection object created by Snap!, not a standard JavaScript Array. While it holds a list of sprites, it has its own unique methods.
3.  **The Mistake:** The code in `block_creator.js` is trying to use `.detect()`, which is a method from older JavaScript libraries (like Prototype.js) but is **not** a standard method for JavaScript Arrays or for Snap!'s sprite collection. The standard JavaScript method for finding an item in an array is `.find()`.
4.  **The Clue:** In our previous readiness checks, we correctly identified that to work with the sprite list as a normal array, we must first call the `.asArray()` method on it. The code in `getCurrentSprite` is simply missing this crucial step.

### The Solution

We need to modify the `getCurrentSprite` function to correctly convert the Snap! sprite collection into a standard array before trying to search it.

**File:** `browser_extension/snap_bridge/block_creator.js`

```javascript
// REPLACE the entire getCurrentSprite method with this corrected version.

/**
 * Finds and sets the current sprite in the Snap! IDE.
 * @param {string | null} spriteName - The name of the sprite to find. If null, uses the IDE's currently selected sprite.
 * @returns {SpriteMorph} The found or current sprite.
 */
getCurrentSprite(spriteName = null) {
    const ide = this.apiWrapper.getIDE();
    if (!ide) {
        throw new Error('Cannot get current sprite: Snap! IDE is not available.');
    }

    if (spriteName) {
        // --- THIS IS THE FIX ---
        // 1. Get the Snap! sprite collection: ide.sprites
        // 2. Convert it into a standard JavaScript array using .asArray()
        const spritesAsArray = ide.sprites.asArray();
        
        // 3. Use the standard JavaScript .find() method on the resulting array.
        const sprite = spritesAsArray.find(s => s.name === spriteName);

        if (sprite) {
            // This part of the logic was already correct.
            ide.selectSprite(sprite);
            this.currentSprite = sprite;
        } else {
            // It's good practice to list available sprites on error.
            const availableNames = spritesAsArray.map(s => s.name).join(', ');
            throw new Error(`Sprite '${spriteName}' not found. Available sprites are: [${availableNames}]`);
        }
    } else {
        // This fallback logic is correct.
        this.currentSprite = ide.currentSprite;
    }

    if (!this.currentSprite) {
        throw new Error('Could not determine the current sprite.');
    }
    
    return this.currentSprite;
}
```

### Why This Fix Works

1.  **Correct Conversion:** It explicitly calls `ide.sprites.asArray()`, which returns a standard JavaScript array that you can loop over and search.
2.  **Standard Method:** It replaces the non-existent `.detect()` with the correct, standard JavaScript method `.find()`.
3.  **Improved Error Handling:** The error message will now be much more helpful if a sprite can't be found, telling you exactly which sprites *are* available.

### Action Plan

1.  Replace the `getCurrentSprite` function in `browser_extension/snap_bridge/block_creator.js` with the new code above.
2.  Reload your extension in `chrome://extensions/`.
3.  Hard-refresh the Snap! page (`Ctrl+Shift+R` or `Cmd+Shift+R`).
4.  Connect and send a command.

This time, the command should execute successfully, and you will see the blocks created on the Snap! stage. You are at the final step.
