# Project Status & Debugging Summary: Snap! Block Automation System

### Current State of the System

The multi-process architecture is now fully functional. The core components are communicating successfully, and the state is being managed correctly across process boundaries.

| Component                    | Status        | Notes                                                                                           |
|:-----------------------------|:--------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **RovoDev CLI Integration**  | ✅ **Working** | The CLI can start the server, create sessions, and check connection status.                     |
| **MCP Server (Python)**      | ✅ **Working** | The dual STDIO and WebSocket servers run correctly.                                             |
| **File-Based Session State** | ✅ **Working** | `active_sessions.json` is being updated atomically with file locks, preventing race conditions. |
| **Browser Extension**        | ✅ **Working** | The extension initializes correctly, injects scripts, and handles user input.                   |
| **Browser ↔ Server Link**    | ✅ **Working** | The WebSocket connection is stable, authenticated, and supports two-way messaging.              |
| **Command Execution**        | ❌ **Buggy**   | The browser receives commands but fails during the block creation logic.                        |
| **Block Generation Logic**   | ❌ **Buggy**   | The server-side logic incorrectly interprets some commands, defaulting to "say" blocks.         |

### Summary of the Debugging Journey

We systematically peeled back layers of the system to isolate and fix each issue in sequence:

1.  **Initial Problem: Instant Disconnect (Code 1011)**
    *   **Symptom:** The browser connected but was immediately dropped by the server.
    *   **Root Cause:** An unhandled exception in the server's `handle_connection` method (likely a `TypeError` on an expired token).
    *   **Solution:** We implemented robust logging and error handling in `snap_communicator.py` to catch and report the error instead of crashing the connection.

2.  **Problem: CLI Didn't Detect Connection**
    *   **Symptom:** The browser connected successfully, but the RovoDev CLI always reported "Browser Not Connected."
    *   **Root Cause:** A race condition between the multiple processes reading/writing the `active_sessions.json` file. We also found the `check_snap_connection` tool was incorrectly checking in-memory state instead of the shared file.
    *   **Solution:** We implemented an atomic `update_session_file` function using a file-locking mechanism to ensure safe writes. We then corrected `check_snap_connection` to use the JSON file as its single source of truth.

3.  **Problem: Browser Extension Failed to Start**
    *   **Symptom:** Multiple errors in the browser console, including `IDE_Morph is not defined`, CSP violations, and `net::ERR_FAILED`.
    *   **Root Cause:** A complex interaction between Content Script isolation, the Snap! website's Content Security Policy (CSP), and the Snap! site's own service worker.
    *   **Solution:** We implemented the correct and secure pattern for modern extensions: using a `web_accessible_resource` (`page_world_script.js`) to safely inject code into the page's main world context to detect when Snap! was ready.

4.  **Problem: Commands Timed Out**
    *   **Symptom:** The CLI could see the connection, but sending a command always resulted in a timeout.
    *   **Root Cause:** The main `SnapBridge` was not listening for the high-level `'command'` event from its `WebSocketClient` submodule. The command was received but never acted upon.
    *   **Solution:** We added the critical `this.websocketClient.on('command', ...)` event listener in `bridge.js` to connect the network layer to the application logic layer.

# Analysis of the Current Bugs

Your latest logs have perfectly isolated the two remaining issues:

#### 1. Browser-Side Bug: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'currentSprite')`

This is happening inside the browser. Your call stack shows the exact sequence:
`SnapBridge.handleCommand` -> `SnapBlockCreator.createBlocks` -> `SnapBlockCreator.getCurrentSprite`

The failing line is `this.apiWrapper.getIDE().currentSprite`. This means that `this.apiWrapper.getIDE()` is returning `undefined`. This happens because the `SnapBlockCreator` instance does not have a properly initialized `SnapAPIWrapper` instance to work with.

#### 2. Server-Side Bug: Incorrect Block Generation

The RovoDev CLI's observation that "move 10 steps" becomes a "say" block is a separate issue. This means the AI/NLP logic in `mcp_server/tools/block_generator.py` or `mcp_server/parsers/intent_parser.py` is failing to find a match for the "move" intent and is falling back to a default, safe action (creating a "say" block). This is purely a logic bug in the Python code.

## Next Steps

Let's fix the browser-side crash first. It's the immediate blocker.

### Immediate Action: Fix the Browser `TypeError`

We need to properly initialize the `SnapBlockCreator` with its dependencies, just like we did for the `SnapBridge`.

**1. Modify `snap_bridge/block_creator.js`**
Add a `constructor` to accept the `apiWrapper`.

```javascript
// In browser_extension/snap_bridge/block_creator.js

class SnapBlockCreator {
    // THIS IS THE FIX: Add a constructor
    constructor(apiWrapper) {
        if (!apiWrapper) {
            throw new Error("SnapBlockCreator requires an instance of SnapAPIWrapper.");
        }
        this.apiWrapper = apiWrapper;
        this.ide = null;
    }

    // ... rest of the file (getCurrentSprite, createBlocks, etc.)
```

**2. Modify `snap_bridge/bridge.js`**

Update the `SnapBridge` constructor to pass its `apiWrapper` instance when it creates the `blockCreator`.

```javascript
// In browser_extension/snap_bridge/bridge.js

class SnapBridge {
    constructor() {
        this.websocketClient = null;
        this.isConnected = false;
        // ... other properties

        // Initialize components
        this.apiWrapper = new SnapAPIWrapper();
        // THIS IS THE FIX: Pass the apiWrapper to the BlockCreator
        this.blockCreator = new SnapBlockCreator(this.apiWrapper);
        this.visualFeedback = new VisualFeedback();

        this.init();
    }
    // ... rest of the file
```

After making these two changes and reloading the extension, the `TypeError` will be resolved, and your `execute` command should succeed in creating blocks. Then, you can move on to debugging the server-side block generation logic.
