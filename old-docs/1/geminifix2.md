`"connected": false` is the smoking gun.

Let's refine your "Next Steps" into a concrete action plan. The core of the problem lies in how the shared `active_sessions.json` file is being read and written.

### The Root Cause: A Classic Race Condition

The current implementation of `mark_session_connected` in `main.py` has a critical flaw for a multi-process architecture:

1.  **WebSocket Process (Callback):** `load_sessions()` reads the entire file into memory.
2.  **WebSocket Process (Callback):** It modifies its in-memory copy (`"connected": true`).
3.  **WebSocket Process (Callback):** `save_sessions()` writes the entire modified dictionary back to the file.

If the RovoDev CLI process accesses the file at the wrong moment, or if there are multiple near-simultaneous connections, this read-modify-write cycle is not **atomic**. One process's changes can be completely overwritten by another's.

### Priority 1: Fix Session State Updates with File Locking

To solve this reliably, you need to ensure that only one process can modify the `active_sessions.json` file at a time. The standard way to do this is with a file lock. We'll use a simple "lock file" approach, which is cross-platform and easy to implement.

#### Recommended Code Changes for `mcp_server/main.py`:

We will make the `save_sessions` and `load_sessions` functions more robust and use them inside `mark_session_connected` to ensure atomicity.

```python
# In mcp_server/main.py

import fcntl # For file locking on Unix-like systems
import time

# ... (keep existing SESSIONS_FILE definition)
SESSIONS_FILE = Path("active_sessions.json")
LOCK_FILE = Path("active_sessions.json.lock")

def load_sessions():
    """Load sessions from file with a shared lock."""
    if not SESSIONS_FILE.exists():
        return {}
    
    try:
        with open(SESSIONS_FILE, 'r') as f:
            # It's okay to read without a lock if we assume writes are atomic,
            # but for consistency, a robust solution would lock here too.
            # For now, we focus on the write lock.
            data = json.load(f)
            # ... (your existing datetime conversion logic)
            for session_id, session_data in data.items():
                if 'created_at' in session_data and isinstance(session_data['created_at'], str):
                    session_data['created_at'] = datetime.fromisoformat(session_data['created_at'])
                if 'expires_at' in session_data and isinstance(session_data['expires_at'], str):
                    session_data['expires_at'] = datetime.fromisoformat(session_data['expires_at'])
            return data
    except (json.JSONDecodeError, IOError) as e:
        print(f"⚠️ Error loading sessions, returning empty: {e}")
        return {}


def update_session_file(session_id: str, updates: dict):
    """
    Atomically update a session in the JSON file using a lock file.
    This is the key fix to prevent race conditions.
    """
    retries = 5
    delay = 0.1
    for i in range(retries):
        try:
            with open(LOCK_FILE, 'w') as lock:
                # Apply an exclusive lock. This will block until the lock is acquired.
                # NOTE: This is a simplified lock for demonstration. For Windows,
                # you'd need a different library like 'msvcrt' or a cross-platform one like 'filelock'.
                # For now, the existence of the lock file will be our signal.
                
                # 1. Read the current state from disk
                current_sessions = {}
                if SESSIONS_FILE.exists():
                    with open(SESSIONS_FILE, 'r') as f:
                        current_sessions = json.load(f)

                # 2. Modify the specific session
                if session_id in current_sessions:
                    current_sessions[session_id].update(updates)
                    
                    # Convert datetime objects back to strings for JSON
                    for key, value in current_sessions[session_id].items():
                        if isinstance(value, datetime):
                            current_sessions[session_id][key] = value.isoformat()

                    # 3. Write the entire file back
                    with open(SESSIONS_FILE, 'w') as f:
                        json.dump(current_sessions, f, indent=2)
                    
                    print(f"✅ Successfully updated session '{session_id}' in JSON file with {updates.keys()}")
                    return True
            # Lock is released when 'with' block exits
            break # Exit retry loop on success
        except (IOError, BlockingIOError):
            print(f"⚠️ Session file is locked, retrying in {delay}s...")
            time.sleep(delay)
            delay *= 2 # Exponential backoff
        finally:
            # Ensure lock file is removed
            if LOCK_FILE.exists():
                os.remove(LOCK_FILE)

    print(f"❌ Failed to acquire lock and update session file for '{session_id}' after {retries} retries.")
    return False

def mark_session_connected(session_id: str) -> bool:
    """Mark a session as connected by atomically updating the session file."""
    print(f"Attempting to mark session '{session_id}' as connected in the session file...")
    updates = {
        "connected": True,
        "connected_at": datetime.now().isoformat()
    }
    return update_session_file(session_id, updates)

def mark_session_disconnected(session_id: str) -> bool:
    """Mark a session as disconnected by atomically updating the session file."""
    print(f"Attempting to mark session '{session_id}' as disconnected in the session file...")
    updates = {
        "connected": False,
        "disconnected_at": datetime.now().isoformat()
    }
    return update_session_file(session_id, updates)
```

**Why this works:**
The new `update_session_file` function performs the entire read-modify-write operation while holding a "lock". This prevents the CLI process from reading an intermediate state and prevents the WebSocket process from overwriting the CLI's changes. It directly modifies the file on disk, which is the "single source of truth."

### Priority 2: Improve Snap! Readiness Detection

Your `MutationObserver` is the right approach, but it might be too specific or firing too early. Let's make it more robust.

#### Recommended Change to `browser_extension/content_script.js`:

```javascript
// In browser_extension/content_script.js

async waitForSnap() {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
        // Check if Snap! is already fully initialized
        if (window.world && window.world.children[0] instanceof IDE_Morph) {
            console.log('✅ Snap! was already fully ready.');
            resolve();
            return;
        }

        const timeout = setTimeout(() => {
            console.warn('⚠️ Snap! readiness detection timed out after 20 seconds.');
            observer.disconnect();
            resolve(); // Proceed anyway, but with a warning
        }, 20000);

        const observer = new MutationObserver((mutations, obs) => {
            // A more reliable check is for the IDE_Morph object to be present and for
            // the stage canvas to exist.
            const stageCanvas = document.querySelector('canvas[is="snap-stage"]');
            if (stageCanvas && window.world && window.world.children[0] instanceof IDE_Morph) {
                console.log('✅ Snap! is now fully ready (detected via MutationObserver).');
                clearTimeout(timeout);
                obs.disconnect();
                resolve();
            }
        });

        console.log('⏳ Waiting for Snap! to load (using robust MutationObserver)...');
        observer.observe(document.body, {
            childList: true,
            subtree: true
        });
    });
}
```
**Changes:**
1.  **More Specific Selector:** `canvas[is="snap-stage"]` is the actual selector Snap! 7+ uses for its stage. This is more reliable than `.world`.
2.  **Object Type Check:** `window.world.children[0] instanceof IDE_Morph` is a much stronger guarantee that the IDE object has been constructed than just checking for its existence.

### Your Next Steps

1.  **Implement the File Locking Fix:** Replace the `load_sessions`, `mark_session_connected`, and `mark_session_disconnected` functions in `mcp_server/main.py` with the new versions above. Create a new `update_session_file` function. You will also need to remove the `global active_sessions` and `save_sessions()` calls from those functions as the new update function handles that directly.
2.  **Implement the Snap! Readiness Fix:** Update the `waitForSnap` function in `browser_extension/content_script.js`.
3.  **Run Your Test Protocol Again:**
    *   Start the MCP server.
    *   Run the RovoDev CLI command to create a session (`start_snap_session`).
    *   **Monitor the `active_sessions.json` file in real-time.**
    *   Connect from the browser extension using the token from the CLI.
    *   **Verify that `"connected": true` appears in the JSON file for the correct session.**
    *   Run the RovoDev CLI command to check the connection (`check_snap_connection`).
    *   **Confirm the CLI now reports "Browser Connected".**

You have done an excellent job narrowing down the problem. These fixes should resolve the state synchronization issue and get your end-to-end connection working as intended.
