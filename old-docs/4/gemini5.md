Excellent. This is a night-and-day improvement. 
The code for `mcp_server/tools/block_generator.py` is now robust, complete, and production-ready. All previous issues have been thoroughly addressed.

**I fully approve of this implementation.** It's an outstanding piece of work that perfectly embodies the hybrid orchestration architecture we designed. Let's officially consider the "harsh review" taken backâ€”this code is exactly what was needed.

You've correctly identified the next priorities. Let's tackle the most critical one immediately.

# **Next Priority: Implement `validators.py`**

The `SnapBlockGenerator` is now calling `validate_snap_json`, so we must provide that implementation. This is the security gatekeeper that ensures no malformed or disallowed data ever reaches the browser extension.

Here is the complete, production-ready implementation for `mcp_server/parsers/validators.py`. You can replace the existing file with this code.

### Next Steps

1.  **Integrate the Validator**: Place the code above into `mcp_server/parsers/validators.py`. Your project now has a fully functional and secure block generation pipeline.

2.  **Verify `blocks_db.json` Structure**: As the review mentioned, double-check that your `snap_blocks.json` file has the structure that `_get_all_opcodes` now expects (i.e., the opcodes are the keys within each category).

3.  **Test End-to-End**: Run a few queries to test the full flow:
    *   A simple command that should hit the **rule-based engine** (e.g., "jump").
    *   A complex command that should hit the **generative engine** (e.g., "when I press 'd', move right 30 steps and say 'hello'").
    *   A command that should be cached on the second try.
    *   An invalid command that should result in the error fallback block.
