
This PRD represents a **significant evolution** from the Scratch POC to a production-ready Snap! system. Here are the key strategic decisions:

## **Why This Architecture is Superior**

### **1. Leverages Snap!'s JavaScript Power**
Unlike Scratch's closed system, Snap! gives us:
- **Direct DOM manipulation** - create blocks programmatically
- **Real-time updates** - no export/import cycles
- **Advanced features** - first-class functions, custom blocks, metaprogramming

### **2. Clean Separation of Concerns**
```
Terminal (UX) ← MCP Server (Logic) ← Snap! Bridge (Execution)
```
Each layer has a single responsibility and clear interfaces.

### **3. Educational First, Technical Second**
Every design decision prioritizes the learning experience:
- Kid-friendly error messages
- Progressive complexity
- Visual feedback
- Explanations accompany code

### **4. Production-Ready from Start**
Unlike the POC, this includes:
- Error handling strategies
- Performance considerations
- Security measures
- Scalability planning

## **Key Technical Innovations**

1. **WebSocket Bridge** - Real-time bidirectional communication
2. **Data-Driven Generation** - JSON knowledge base approach from our Scratch design
3. **Visual Feedback** - Blocks animate as they're created
4. **State Inspection** - Can read current Snap! project state

## **Next Steps**

Would you like me to:
1. **Create detailed JavaScript implementations** for the Snap! bridge?
2. **Design the WebSocket protocol** specifications?
3. **Build the MCP tools** with Snap!-specific block generation?
4. **Create the knowledge base** with Snap! block definitions?
