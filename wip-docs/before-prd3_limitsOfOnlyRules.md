# Current Status and Next Steps

We have successfully built a robust technical pipeline. The connection is stable, commands are queued correctly, and the extension has proper access to the Snap! environment.

**The current issue is purely in the application logic:**

1.  **Server-Side:** When the user says "move 10 steps right", the Python `block_generator.py` fails to match this to a known block in its JSON knowledge base. As a **fallback**, it generates a command to create a `doSay` block (a dialog box) instead.
2.  **Client-Side:** The JavaScript `block_creator.js` receives the `doSay` opcode, but it doesn't currently have the logic to build that specific type of block, resulting in a silent failure where no blocks are created.

Our next chat will focus on refining this application logic. We will need to examine the **`block_generator.py`** and its knowledge files to correctly parse user intent, and enhance **`block_creator.js`** to reliably build any block the server instructs it to create.

Here is an overview of the system's logic, its knowledge base, and a step-by-step guide to achieving the proof-of-concept of making a sprite "move 10 steps right."

# Overall Picture of the Current Logic Implementation

The system is comprised of three primary components that work in concert:

1.  **The Python Backend (`mcp_server`)**:
    *   `snap_communicator.py`: This acts as the central nervous system. It establishes a WebSocket server that listens for connections from the browser extension. Its key responsibilities are managing connections, validating sessions, and providing a high-level API (`create_blocks`, `read_project`, etc.) for other parts of the server to communicate with Snap!. It ensures that data is correctly formatted into a standard JSON protocol before being sent over the WebSocket. A critical detail is in the `create_blocks` function, which now correctly unwraps the payload, preventing the double-nesting issue from the past.
    *   `block_generator.py`: This is the "brain" of the operation. It takes a structured `ParsedIntent` and uses two JSON files (`snap_blocks.json` and `patterns.json`) as its knowledge base to determine which Snap! blocks to create. It first tries to match the user's command to a high-level "pattern" (a pre-defined sequence of blocks). If no pattern is found, it attempts to match the command to a single, known block. If both of those fail, it executes its **fallback logic**: creating a `doSay` block that verbalizes the user's unfulfilled command.

2.  **The Knowledge Base (`knowledge/`)**:
    *   `snap_blocks.json`: This file is a dictionary of individual Snap! blocks. It defines their `opcode` (the internal Snap! name), their category (motion, looks, etc.), the parameters they accept, and default values. This allows the `block_generator` to construct a single block from scratch.
    *   `patterns.json`: This file defines common, high-level actions that may involve multiple blocks. For example, a "jump" pattern is defined as a `changeYBy` block, a `doWait` block, and another `changeYBy` block. Each pattern has a list of `triggers` (natural language phrases) that map to it. This is the first place the `block_generator` looks to match a user's intent.

3.  **The Frontend JavaScript (`snap_bridge/`)**:
    *   `block_creator.js`: This script is injected directly into the Snap! IDE's webpage. It receives JSON commands from the `snap_communicator`. Its primary function, `createBlocks`, iterates through a list of block specifications sent by the server. For each specification, it uses the internal Snap! API to create the corresponding block, set its inputs, and connect it to the previous block in the sequence. It was previously failing silently because it did not have logic to handle the `doSay` opcode, but this logic can be added. The fix to correctly find a sprite by name (`ide.sprites.asArray().find()`) was a crucial step in stabilizing this component.

### High-Order Categorical Groups of the Knowledge Base

The knowledge base can be conceptually organized into these categories:

*   **Core Motion**: Fundamental, single-axis movements (`forward`, `changeXBy`, `changeYBy`, `turnRight`, `turnLeft`). These are the most basic building blocks of animation.
*   **Positional Motion**: Actions that place the sprite in a specific state or location (`gotoXY`, `bounceOffEdge`).
*   **Appearance & Communication**: Blocks that alter the sprite's visuals or make it "speak" (`doSay`, `hide`, `show`, `changeSize`, `changeEffect`).
*   **Sound & Events**: Blocks related to audio output and, critically, the "hat blocks" that start every script (`doPlaySound`, `receiveGo`, `receiveKey`).
*   **Control Flow**: The logic that governs execution, such as loops and delays (`doWait`, `doRepeat`, `doForever`).
*   **Sensing & Operators**: Advanced blocks that allow for interactivity by checking for conditions (`reportTouchingObject`, `reportKeyPressed`) or performing calculations (`reportSum`, `reportRandom`).
*   **Multi-Block Patterns**: These are composite actions built from the primitives above. They represent more complex ideas that a user might express, such as:
    *   **Animated Actions**: `jump`, `spin`, `dance`, `grow_shrink`.
    *   **Interactive Behaviors**: `follow_mouse`, `bouncing_ball`.
    *   **Visual Effects**: `change_colors`.

### How to Create a Simple Proof of Concept: "Move Sprite 10 Steps Right"

The reason this command currently fails is due to a mismatch between the user's phrasing and the triggers defined in the knowledge base. The system correctly identifies the intent to "move right" but doesn't find a matching pattern or block. Here is how to fix it and achieve the desired outcome:

**Step 1: Understand the Failure Point**

1.  **User Input**: "move 10 steps right"
2.  **Intent Parsing**: The (assumed) parser correctly identifies the action as "move right" and a parameter of "10 steps."
3.  **`block_generator.py` Lookup**:
    *   It checks `patterns.json`. The `move_right` pattern has triggers like "move right," "go right," and "right." This *should* match. The issue might be that the parser is sending the action as "move 10 steps right," which doesn't exactly match the trigger.
    *   If the pattern lookup fails, it checks `snap_blocks.json`. It looks for a block definition containing "move 10 steps right." None exists.
    *   **Fallback**: Since both lookups fail, it generates the `doSay` block with the message "I want to move 10 steps right."
4.  **`block_creator.js` Execution**: The JavaScript receives the `doSay` opcode. If the logic to create this specific block isn't present in the `createSingleBlock` function, nothing appears on the screen.

**Step 2: Implement the Solution**

The most robust way to solve this is to ensure the `move_right` pattern is correctly identified and used.

**Action 1: Broaden the Pattern Trigger in `patterns.json`**

The simplest fix is to make the trigger more flexible. While the current triggers are good, adding a more general one can help.

In `mcp_server/knowledge/patterns.json`, update the `move_right` pattern to include "steps right":

```json
{
  "patterns": {
    "move_right": {
      "blocks": [
        {
          "opcode": "changeXBy",
          "inputs": {"DX": 10},
          "category": "motion"
        }
      ],
      "explanation": "Moves sprite to the right!",
      "difficulty": "beginner",
      "triggers": ["move right", "go right", "right", "move forward", "steps right"],
      "estimated_time_ms": 100,
      "teaching_points": [
        "X coordinates control left-right movement",
        "Positive X moves right"
      ]
    },
    ...
  }
}
```

**Action 2: Ensure the `block_generator` Can Handle Parameters**

The `block_generator.py` needs to be intelligent enough to extract the number "10" from the intent and apply it to the block. The current `_create_blocks_from_pattern` does not seem to use the `intent.parameters`. Let's assume for this POC that the intent parser correctly identifies `{'steps': 10}`. The generator needs to be modified to use this parameter.

In `mcp_server/tools/block_generator.py`, update `_create_blocks_from_pattern` to be parameter-aware:

```python
    def _create_blocks_from_pattern(self, pattern: Dict[str, Any], intent: ParsedIntent) -> List[SnapBlock]:
        """Create blocks from a pattern definition, applying intent parameters."""
        blocks = []

        for i, block_spec in enumerate(pattern.get("blocks", [])):
            # --- START MODIFICATION ---
            
            # Copy original inputs to avoid modifying the pattern in memory
            final_inputs = block_spec.get("inputs", {}).copy()

            # Override default pattern inputs with parameters from the user's intent
            if block_spec["opcode"] == "changeXBy" and "steps" in intent.parameters:
                final_inputs["DX"] = intent.parameters["steps"]
            elif block_spec["opcode"] == "forward" and "steps" in intent.parameters:
                final_inputs["STEPS"] = intent.parameters["steps"]
            # Add more parameter-aware logic here for other patterns...
            
            # --- END MODIFICATION ---

            block = SnapBlock(
                opcode=block_spec["opcode"],
                category=BlockCategory(block_spec.get("category", "motion")),
                inputs=final_inputs, # Use the modified inputs
                description=f"Pattern block {i+1}"
            )
            blocks.append(block)

        return blocks
```

**Action 3: Verify `block_creator.js` Can Create the `changeXBy` Block (It already can)**

The final step is to ensure the frontend can physically create the block. Examining `block_creator.js`, the `createSingleBlock` function is generic. It uses `sprite.blockForSelector(opcode)`, which works for most standard blocks, including `changeXBy`. The `setBlockInputs` function correctly sets the value in the block. Therefore, no changes are needed on the frontend for this specific command.

By making these changes, the system will now successfully execute the "move 10 steps right" command, laying a solid foundation for tackling more interesting and complex problems.
