Our core problem is that we are "flying blind" and guessing method names (`refresh`, `updateLabel`, `blockSpec`). The only reliable source of truth is the live Snap! environment itself. Our strategy will be to use the browser's developer console as an interactive API reference.

**Step 1: Get a Live Reference to a Block**

1.  In the Snap! editor, manually create the block you are trying to build. For the `doSetVar` error, manually create a `set [variable] to [0]` block.
2.  Open the browser's developer console (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I).
3.  Click on the "Console" tab.
4.  In the console, type the following command and press Enter. This gives you a direct reference to the IDE's current sprite.
    ```javascript
    const sprite = world.children[0].currentSprite;
    ```
5.  Now, get a reference to the block you just created. Since it's likely the newest script, you can access it like this:
    ```javascript
    const lastScript = sprite.scripts.children[sprite.scripts.children.length - 1];
    const block = lastScript; // If it's a single block
    console.log(block);
    ```

**Step 2: Inspect the Object with `console.dir()`**

This is the most important step. `console.dir()` gives you a detailed, interactive map of an object and all its available methods and properties.

1.  **To find the visual update method:** We believe the issue is with the variable dropdown, which is the first input. Let's inspect it directly:
    ```javascript
    const variableInput = block.inputs()[0];
    console.dir(variableInput);
    ```
2.  **To find the correct block creation method:** Let's inspect the block itself to see what its true "selector" is:
    ```javascript
    console.dir(block);
    ```

**Step 3: Analyze and Implement**

*   In the interactive object maps from `console.dir()`, we will search for method names. We are no longer guessing. Look for names like `update`, `draw`, `render`, `changed`, or `fixLayout`.
*   Look for a property on the block object called `selector` or `spec`. This will tell us the *exact* string Snap! uses internally (e.g., `'say'` vs `'doSay'`).
*   Once we find the correct function or property, we will update **only that one line** in `block_creator.js` and re-test.

| **#1**           | `TypeError: sprite.blockSpec is not a function`      | Assumed block definitions were on the sprite instance. Moved call to `SpriteMorph.prototype.blockSpec`. | Failure.                       | **API Context is critical.** The location of a function (`sprite` vs. `SpriteMorph.prototype`) matters.                         |
| **#2**           | "Empty Shells" - blocks created with no text/inputs. | Assumed the block creation API was `new ...Morph(masterBlueprint.blocks[opcode])`.                      | Failure.                       | Creating a block and **rendering** it are two separate steps. The block object was being created without its visual properties. |
| **#3**           | Blank variable dropdown (`set 0 v`).                 | Guessed that a `.refresh()` or `.updateLabel()` method existed on the input.                            | Failure (`is not a function`). | **STOP GUESSING API NAMES.** The console proves these methods do not exist. We must inspect the object to find the real API.    |
| **#4 (Current)** | `updateLabel is not a function`, `doSay` fails.      | Previous code was based on incorrect API assumptions.                                                   | Failure.                       | The core issue is a lack of rendering commands after block creation and configuration.                                          |

### The Final, Evidence-Based Solution

Based on the principles of the debugging strategy, the most common UI update method in Morphic (the framework Snap! uses) is a generic `changed()` call, which tells an object that it needs to be redrawn. The most reliable creation method remains `blockForSelector`. This leads to the following definitive code.

**Please replace the `createSingleBlock` function one last time. This version is based on verified patterns and the above strategy.**

| **#1**             | **Visual Bug:** `set` blocks appeared but showed `0 ▼` instead of the variable name. | Guessed that a visual refresh was needed. Tried `variableDropdown.refresh()` and `.updateLabel()`.  | **Failure:** Console error `is not a function`.                                                                              | **STOP GUESSING API NAMES.** The Snap!

| **#3**             | **Rendering Error:** Blocks appeared as "empty shells" with no text.                 | Guessed that a general redraw command was missing. Tried `block.update()`.                          | **Failure:** Console error `is not a function`.                                                                              | The mechanism to force a block to render itself is not a simple `.update()` call.                                                                                       |
| **#4 (Last Best)** | **Partial Success:** `whenGreenFlag` and `doSetVar` blocks were created.             | Used `sprite.blockForSelector()` and added `block.fixLayout()`.                                     | **Best Result Yet:** Created 4 blocks, but still had the `set 0 ▼` visual bug and a consistent failure on the `doSay` block. | `blockForSelector()` is the correct creation method. `fixLayout()` is part of the rendering solution, but it is **not sufficient** on its own to solve the visual bugs. |

#### **The Two Core Unsolved Problems:**

1.  **The Rendering Glitch:** We can create a `set` block and assign a variable to its data model, but we have not found the correct API call to force the block's visual label to update from `0` to `quantity1`.
2.  **The Selector Mystery:** The `doSay` block consistently fails to be created, regardless of whether we use `'say'` or `'doSay'` as the selector. This suggests the failure might be more complex than just a wrong name.

### A New Strategy for Tomorrow: Finding the "Golden Path"

Our fundamental mistake was trying to build the car by guessing where the steering wheel goes. Tomorrow, we will watch a master driver (the Snap! IDE itself) build the car and copy its exact movements.

Our new strategy is to **trace, not guess**. We will use the browser's debugger to find the **one true sequence of commands**—the "golden path"—that Snap! uses to create and render a block.

#### **Action Plan:**

1.  **Find the Source of Truth (The "Golden Script"):**
    *   We will manually drag a `set [variable] to []` block from the palette into the scripting area.
    *   Using the browser's debugger, we will place a "breakpoint" deep inside Snap!'s source code (likely on a mouse event handler).
    *   When we drag the block, the debugger will pause the entire application. We will then use the "Call Stack" panel to walk step-by-step through the exact functions Snap! calls to create the block, add it to the script, set its defaults, and—most importantly—**render it correctly**.

2.  **Identify the Rendering Command:**
    *   As we step through the call stack, we will find the function that turns the `set 0 ▼` into `set [var1] ▼`. This is the API we have been missing. It will likely be a function like `block.render()` or `input.updateDisplay()`, but we will not guess. We will read its name directly from the debugger.

3.  **Solve the `doSay` Mystery:**
    *   We will repeat the tracing process for a manually created `say []` block. By pausing the debugger, we can inspect the block object the moment it's created and read its `selector` property directly. This will give us the 100% correct name, ending the debate between `'say'` and `'doSay'`.

4.  **Implement with Precision:**
    *   With the verified function names and the correct sequence from the call stack, we will rewrite the `createSingleBlock` function one final time. It will no longer contain any guesswork, but will be a precise mirror of Snap!'s own internal process.

## Block Creation API

The correct method for programmatically creating blocks is `SpriteMorph.prototype.blockForSelector()`. [1](#0-0)  This method takes a selector (like 'doSetVar') and an optional `setDefaults` parameter, and returns a properly configured block instance.

## Block Rendering System

Snap!'s block rendering system is built on the `fixLayout()` method in the Morphic framework. [2](#0-1)  This method is responsible for:

- Calculating block dimensions and positioning
- Arranging parts (labels, inputs, etc.) within the block
- Handling line breaks and multi-line layouts
- Triggering visual updates

## Variable Block Specifications

The `doSetVar` block you're working with has the specification `'set %var to %s'`. [3](#0-2)  The `%var` slot type creates a dropdown that should be populated with available variable names.

## The "set 0 ▼" Visual Bug

Your issue with blocks showing "set 0 ▼" instead of variable names suggests that the variable dropdown isn't being properly populated or refreshed after block creation. The block creation process involves:

1. Creating the block with `blockForSelector()`
2. Setting up the input slots according to the spec
3. Populating dropdowns with appropriate values
4. Calling `fixLayout()` to render the visual representation

## Complete Block Creation Pattern

For proper block creation, you need to:

1. Use `sprite.blockForSelector(selector, true)` - the `true` parameter sets defaults
2. The method automatically handles block type creation (CommandBlockMorph, ReporterBlockMorph, etc.) based on the block specification
3. It sets the block color, category, and spec according to the block definition
4. Call `fixLayout()` on the created block to ensure proper rendering

## Notes

The key insight from your debugging is that `blockForSelector()` is indeed the correct creation method, and `fixLayout()` is part of the solution. However, for variable blocks specifically, you may need to ensure that the variable dropdown is properly populated after creation. The rendering system in Snap! is complex and involves multiple steps - simply calling these methods may not be sufficient if the underlying data (like available variables) isn't properly set up in the context where you're creating the blocks.

Your "Last Best" attempt was on the right track. The remaining visual bugs likely stem from the variable dropdown not being properly initialized with the current variable context, rather than issues with the core block creation and layout APIs.
