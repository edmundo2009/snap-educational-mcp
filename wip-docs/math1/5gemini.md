### Decoding the Errors: A Guide to Debugging Your Snap! Extension

It appears you're encountering a classic disconnect between the JSON data your Python script generates and what the Snap! environment anticipates. Let's break down the debugging process to get your math-focused Snap! extension up and running.

#### The Core of the Problem: Mismatched Opcodes and JSON Structure

The primary issue is that your `block_generator.py` is creating blocks with opcodes like `setVar` and `say`, but Snap! internally uses different names for these functions. Additionally, the JSON structure you're creating isn't directly executable in the browser console, leading to the `Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ':'` error. This error typically occurs when you try to run a JSON object as if it were a JavaScript statement.

#### Debugging Step-by-Step:

**1. Correcting the Opcodes in `block_generator.py`:**

Snap! uses `doSetVar` for setting variables and `doSay` for making a sprite speak. You'll need to update your Python code to reflect this.

In `mcp_server/tools/block_generator.py`, locate the `_get_block_category` method and modify it to use the correct opcodes:

```python
def _get_block_category(self, opcode: str) -> str:
    """Get category for a block opcode."""
    # Default categories for common opcodes
    category_map = {
        "doSetVar": "variables",
        "doSay": "looks",
        "whenGreenFlag": "control"
    }
    return category_map.get(opcode, "looks")
```

Next, you need to ensure that your `generate_from_math_pattern` function is using these corrected opcodes. You should create a mapping to translate the simple opcodes from your `math_patterns.json` to the correct Snap! opcodes.

A good approach is to create a normalization function:

```python
def _normalize_opcode(self, opcode: str) -> str:
    """Convert to Snap! native opcodes"""
    mapping = {
        "setVar": "doSetVar",
        "say": "doSay"
    }
    return mapping.get(opcode, opcode)
```

Then, in your `generate_from_math_pattern` function, use this normalization when creating the `SnapBlock` object:

```python

snap_block = SnapBlock(
    block_id=block_id,
    opcode=self._normalize_opcode(block.get("opcode", "say")),
    category=self._get_block_category(self._normalize_opcode(block.get("opcode", "say"))),
    inputs=self._format_block_inputs(block),
    is_hat_block=(i == 0),
    next=next_id
)

```

**2. Verifying Snap!'s Expected Opcodes:**

The error `Uncaught TypeError: SpriteMorph.prototype.blockSpecs is not a function` indicates that this specific function doesn't exist in the Snap! environment you're using. To find the correct opcodes, you can try an alternative approach in the Snap! browser console. After opening a project, you can inspect the XML of saved projects to see the block opcodes. You can also explore the Snap! source code if you're comfortable with that. The Snap! Wiki can also be a valuable resource for understanding block structures.

**3. Correctly Pasting JSON into the Snap! Console:**

The `Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ':'` error arises because you can't just paste a raw JSON object into the console and expect it to be interpreted as a command. You'll need to wrap it in a JavaScript command that tells Snap! what to do with the data.

While there isn't a direct, simple command to paste and create blocks for security reasons, you would typically interact with the Snap! API through a browser extension, which is the architecture you're building. The JSON you are generating is intended to be sent to your extension, which will then use the appropriate Snap! internal functions to create the blocks.

**4. Refining `math_patterns.json`:**

For a more robust solution, consider updating your `math_patterns.json` to use the correct Snap! opcodes directly. This will simplify your Python code and reduce the chances of errors.

Here's an example of how you could structure a pattern in `math_patterns.json`:

```json
{
  "patterns": {
    "unit_rate": {
      "blocks": [
        {
          "opcode": "whenGreenFlag",
          "category": "control"
        },
        {
          "opcode": "doSetVar",
          "category": "variables",
          "var": "quantity1",
          "value": "{{num1}}"
        },
        {
          "opcode": "doSetVar",
          "category": "variables",
          "var": "quantity2",
          "value": "{{num2}}"
        },
        {
          "opcode": "doSetVar",
          "category": "variables",
          "var": "unit_rate",
          "value": "{{num1}} / {{num2}}"
        },
        {
          "opcode": "doSay",
          "category": "looks",
          "message": "Unit rate is: ({{num1}} / {{num2}})"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

By making these adjustments, your Python backend will generate JSON that is more closely aligned with what your Snap! extension's `block_creator.js` will expect, leading to a smoother debugging process and a functional extension.
